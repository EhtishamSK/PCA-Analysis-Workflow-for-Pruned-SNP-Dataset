This script provides a complete workflow for performing principal component analysis (PCA) and generating VCF file of the pruned SNPs. It includes steps to convert raw genotype data into PLINK binary format, perform LD-based marker pruning, calculate a genetic distance matrix for PCA, and generate a HAMMAP format file for STRUCTURE analysis. The pipeline ensures that only unlinked SNPs are used, improving the reliability and accuracy of population structure and diversity studies.
